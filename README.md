# Automating web-based Email sending
# Good example of where great logic, mediates great design

This is a program that automates the generation of HTML based emails. It offers a high level of flexebility when it comes to importing images, files, and different HTML based functionalities, and at the same time, allows for complete automation of sending emails. 
This script is useful for sending communications to hundreds or thousands of people, while at the same time, maintaining a very high level of aesthetic interface.
+I imported the Bootsrap library in the automatically generated emails, which adds to the flexebility and simplicity for email design


This script is reliable and could be used by whoever needs to send a big amount of emails, while at the same time, mainting a professional and well designed look.

The data displayed in the email can be static "paragraphs and headings" or variables "person's name, email, number". The variable data is pulled from an Excel sheet which contains the information. I have provided a sample Excel sheet if you would like to take a look.
To access this code, you can simply open an excel sheet and enable the developer option. After that, just open up VBA and copy this code
